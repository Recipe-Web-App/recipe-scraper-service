        Creates a new recipe collection owned by the authenticated user.

        **Batch Operations:**
        - Optionally include `recipeIds` to add recipes to the collection during creation
        - Optionally include `collaboratorIds` to add collaborators during creation
          (only applicable when `collaborationMode` is `SPECIFIC_USERS`)
        - Optionally include `tags` to associate tags with the collection during creation

        This reduces multiple API calls to a single request when creating a collection
        with initial recipes, collaborators, and/or tags.
