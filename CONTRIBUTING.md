# Contributing to Recipe Scraper Service

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Recipe Scraper Service as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Poetry 2.1.3+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git with pre-commit hooks

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jsamuelsen/recipe-scraper-service.git
cd recipe-scraper-service

# Install dependencies
poetry install
poetry shell

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start development server
poetry run dev
```

## Code Style and Standards

### Code Formatting
- **Black**: Code formatting with 88 character line length
- **isort**: Import sorting with Black profile
- **Ruff**: Comprehensive linting with auto-fix capabilities

### Type Checking
- **MyPy**: Strict type checking is required
- All functions must have type hints
- Return types must be explicitly declared

### Documentation
- **Google-style docstrings** are required for all public functions and classes
- **pydoclint** validation ensures documentation completeness
- API endpoints must include comprehensive OpenAPI documentation

### Security
- **Bandit** security analysis for Python code
- **Safety** dependency vulnerability scanning
- **detect-secrets** prevents secrets from being committed
- All security issues must be addressed before merging

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
- Minimum 80% test coverage required (target 95%)
- Coverage below 80% will fail the build
- All new features must include comprehensive tests

### Test Organization
```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/          # Fast, isolated tests with mocked dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/   # End-to-end API tests with real databases
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ performance/   # Load testing and benchmarks
```

### Test Naming Convention
- Use `*_test.py` pattern (not `test_*.py`)
- Test files should mirror the application structure
- Test functions should be descriptive: `test_create_recipe_with_valid_url_returns_201`

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pytest --cov=app tests/

# Run only unit tests (fast)
poetry run test-unit

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Run performance benchmarks
pytest tests/performance/ --benchmark-only

# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html tests/
```

## Quality Assurance

### Pre-commit Hooks
All code must pass pre-commit hooks before submission:

```bash
# Run all checks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Individual checks
black .
isort .
ruff check . --fix
mypy app/
bandit app/
safety check
```

### Code Complexity
- **Radon** complexity analysis must maintain grade B or higher
- Functions with complexity grade C or lower require refactoring
- Maintainability index must remain above threshold

feat!: redesign API response format

BREAKING CHANGE: All API responses now use the new standardized format
```

### Examples
```
feat(api): add ingredient substitution endpoint
fix(cache): resolve Redis connection timeout issue
security(auth): implement rate limiting for login endpoint
