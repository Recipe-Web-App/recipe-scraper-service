# Recipe Scraper Service - Postman Collection

This directory contains Postman collection and environment files for comprehensive API testing of the Recipe Scraper Service.

## Files Overview

### Collection Files

- **`Recipe-Scraper-Service.postman_collection.json`** - Complete API collection covering all endpoints including recipe scraping, nutritional analysis, ingredient substitutions, shopping information, and health monitoring

### Environment Files

- **`Recipe-Scraper-Development.postman_environment.json`** - Development environment variables (passwords as placeholders)
- **`Recipe-Scraper-Local.postman_environment.json`** - Local development environment variables (passwords as placeholders)
- **`*-Private.postman_environment.json`** - Local-only files with real passwords (gitignored)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Import Collections and Environments

1. **Import Collection:**
   - Open Postman
   - Click "Import" button
   - Select `Recipe-Scraper-Service.postman_collection.json` file
   - Collection will appear in your workspace

2. **Import Environment Templates:**
   - Import both environment files:
     `Recipe-Scraper-Development.postman_environment.json` and
     `Recipe-Scraper-Local.postman_environment.json`

### 2. Set Up Private Environment with Passwords

The environment files in Git have placeholder values for passwords. To use them locally:

1. **Create Private Environment Files:**

   ```bash
   # Copy the environment files and add '-Private' suffix
   cp Recipe-Scraper-Development.postman_environment.json \
      Recipe-Scraper-Development-Private.postman_environment.json
   cp Recipe-Scraper-Local.postman_environment.json \
      Recipe-Scraper-Local-Private.postman_environment.json
   ```

2. **Add Real Passwords:**
   Edit your `-Private` files and replace these placeholder values:
   - `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN` → Your actual authentication token
   - `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN` → Your actual admin token (if different)

3. **Import Private Environments:**
   - Import your `-Private.postman_environment.json` files into Postman
   - Use these private environments for actual testing
   - The `-Private` files are automatically gitignored

4. **Select Environment:**
   - Choose the appropriate private environment from the dropdown in Postman's top-right corner

- **Get Recipe Shopping Info** - Complete shopping list with total cost estimates for entire recipes

### 7. Administrative Operations

Administrative endpoints requiring elevated permissions:
- **Clear Cache** - Clear service cache (requires admin authentication)

## Environment Variables

### Base URLs

- **`recipeScraperServiceBaseUrl`** - Recipe Scraper service base URL

### Authentication

- **`recipeScraperServiceAuthToken`** - Bearer token for API authentication (secret type)
- **`recipeScraperServiceAdminToken`** - Admin-level authentication token (secret type)

### Test Data Variables

- **`recipeScraperServiceTestRecipeId`** - Sample recipe ID for testing
- **`recipeScraperServiceTestIngredientId`** - Sample ingredient ID for testing
- **`recipeScraperServiceAllRecipesUrl`** - Sample AllRecipes URL for recipe creation
- **`recipeScraperServiceFoodNetworkUrl`** - Sample Food Network URL for recipe creation

### Auto-managed Variables

These variables are automatically set by test scripts:
- **`recipeScraperServiceCreatedRecipeId`** - Dynamically set recipe ID from create operations
- **`recipeScraperServiceCreatedIngredientId`** - Dynamically set ingredient ID from responses

## Automatic Response Field Extraction

The collection includes robust test scripts that automatically extract important response fields and store them as environment variables for use in subsequent requests:

### Recipe Management Flow

- Create Recipe requests automatically extract the new recipe ID for use in subsequent operations
- Recipe responses extract ingredient IDs for nutritional and shopping queries
- All requests include status code validation and response structure validation

### Authentication Flow

- Authentication headers are automatically applied using stored tokens
- Admin endpoints automatically use admin-level tokens when available

## Environment Switching

**Development Environment:**

- Recipe Scraper Service: `http://recipe-scraper.local/api/v1/recipe-scraper`

**Local Environment:**

- Recipe Scraper Service: `http://localhost:8000`

Switch between environments using the environment selector dropdown in Postman's top-right corner.

## Security Features

- **Password Protection**: Sensitive tokens are excluded from Git repository
- **Private Environment Pattern**: Use local `-Private` files for credentials (automatically gitignored)
- **Secret Variables**: Tokens are marked as secret type in Postman
- **Automatic Token Management**: Bearer tokens are automatically applied through collection-level authentication
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate environments prevent accidental cross-environment requests

### Security Model

- **Git Repository**: Contains collections and environment templates with placeholder tokens
- **Local Development**: Uses private environment files with real credentials
- **Team Collaboration**: Secure sharing of API structure without exposing credentials

## Usage Workflow

### Getting Started

1. Import collection file and environment templates
2. Set up private environment files with real authentication tokens (see setup instructions above)
3. Select appropriate private environment (Development-Private or Local-Private)
4. Start with health checks to verify service connectivity
5. Use recipe creation to generate test data
6. Explore nutritional, recommendation, and shopping features
7. Test admin operations if you have admin privileges

### Typical Testing Flow

3. **Nutritional Analysis** - Get nutritional breakdown for the created recipe
4. **Ingredient Substitutions** - Find alternatives for specific ingredients
5. **Recipe Pairings** - Get complementary recipe suggestions
6. **Shopping Information** - Get pricing and shopping details
7. **Admin Operations** - Clear cache or perform maintenance (if authorized)

## Test Script Features
