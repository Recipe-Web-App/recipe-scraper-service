## Common Questions

### Setup and Configuration

**Q: How do I install and run the service locally?**

A: Follow these steps:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Recipe-Web-App/recipe-scraper-service.git
cd recipe-scraper-service

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run the service
poetry run dev
```

See [README.md](../README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**Q: What environment variables do I need to configure?**

A: Essential environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection string (optional, for caching)
- `SPOONACULAR_API_KEY` - Spoonacular API key for nutritional data
- `SECRET_KEY` - Secret key for security features

See `.env.example` for a complete list and [DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md) for production configuration.

**Q: How do I get a Spoonacular API key?**

A: Visit https://spoonacular.com/food-api to sign up for a free or paid API key.

### Using the API

**Q: How do I scrape a recipe from a URL?**

A: Make a POST request to `/api/v1/recipes/scrape`:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/recipes/scrape" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com/recipe"}'
```

See [API.md](../API.md) for complete API documentation.

**Q: What recipe websites are supported?**

A: The service uses the `recipe-scrapers` library which supports 100+ popular recipe websites. See `config/recipe_scraping/recipe_blog_urls.json` for a curated list of popular sites.

**Q: How do I get nutritional information for a recipe?**

A: Use the `/api/v1/nutritional-info/analyze` endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/nutritional-info/analyze" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"recipe_id": "your-recipe-id"}'
```

### Common Errors

**Q: I'm getting a "Database connection failed" error. What should I do?**

A: Check the following:
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running
2. Verify your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` is correct
3. Check database credentials and permissions
4. Ensure the database exists

**Q: Recipe scraping is failing for certain websites. Why?**

A: Possible causes:
1. The website may have changed its HTML structure
2. The website may block scraping attempts
3. Rate limiting may be in effect
4. The website may not be supported by `recipe-scrapers`

Try scraping from a different source or open an issue with the specific URL.

**Q: I'm getting "API rate limit exceeded" errors. What should I do?**

A: The service implements rate limiting to prevent abuse:
1. Check your request frequency
2. Implement backoff and retry logic in your client
3. Consider caching responses
4. Contact us if you need higher rate limits

### Development

**Q: How do I run tests?**

A: Run tests using pytest:
```bash
# All tests with coverage
pytest --cov=app tests/

# Unit tests only
poetry run test-unit

# Specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_recipe_service.py
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed testing guidelines.

**Q: How do I format and lint my code?**

A: Use the provided tools:
```bash
# Format code
poetry run black .
poetry run isort .

# Lint code
poetry run ruff check .

# Type check
poetry run mypy app/

# Or run pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Q: What Python version should I use?**

A: Python 3.13 is required (strict requirement per CLAUDE.md).
