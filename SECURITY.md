# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

### 2. Report privately

Send details to: **security@jsamuelsen.dev** or create a private security advisory on GitHub.

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix timeline**: Based on severity (1-30 days)
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is deployed

## Security Measures

### Application Security

#### Input Validation
- All API inputs validated using Pydantic schemas
- SQL injection prevention through SQLAlchemy ORM
- XSS prevention through proper output encoding
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication (planned)
- Role-based access control (planned)
- API key authentication for external integrations
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

#### Data Protection
- Sensitive data encryption at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Secure session management
- No sensitive data in logs

### Infrastructure Security

#### Container Security
- Non-root container execution
- Minimal base images (distroless)
- Regular security scanning with Trivy
- Resource limits and quotas

#### Network Security
- Network policies in Kubernetes
- Firewall rules for port restrictions
- VPC/subnet isolation
- Secure service-to-service communication

#### Secrets Management
- Environment variable-based configuration
- Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data
- External secret management integration (planned)
- Regular secret rotation

### Code Security

#### Static Analysis
- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **Semgrep**: Advanced security patterns
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis

#### Dependency Management
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Pin exact versions in production
- License compliance checking

#### Secure Development
- Pre-commit hooks with security checks
- Code review requirements for security-sensitive changes
- Security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Threat modeling for new features

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Never commit these to version control:
```bash
# Database credentials
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
RECIPE_SCRAPER_DB_PASSWORD=

# API keys
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=

# Security keys
SECRET_KEY=
JWT_SECRET_KEY=
```

### Secure Defaults

Production configuration includes:
```bash
# Security headers
SECURE_HEADERS_ENABLED=true
HSTS_MAX_AGE=31536000
CONTENT_TYPE_OPTIONS=nosniff
FRAME_OPTIONS=DENY

# Rate limiting
ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=100
RATE_LIMIT_BURST=200

# CORS
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["https://yourdomain.com"]
ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=true
```

### TLS Configuration

```nginx
# Nginx SSL configuration
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;
ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
ssl_session_timeout 10m;
```

## Security Scanning

### Automated Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:
- **Secret scanning**: Prevents credential commits
- **Container scanning**: Vulnerability assessment
- **Dependency scanning**: Known vulnerability detection
- **Code analysis**: Security pattern detection

### Manual Security Testing

Regular security assessments include:
- Penetration testing
- Code audits
- Infrastructure reviews
- Compliance checks

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process

1. **Detection**: Automated alerts and monitoring
2. **Assessment**: Severity and impact evaluation
3. **Containment**: Immediate threat mitigation
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis
5. **Recovery**: Service restoration
6. **Lessons Learned**: Process improvement

### Contact Information

- **Security Team**: security@jsamuelsen.dev
- **Emergency**: Create GitHub security advisory
- **General Issues**: GitHub issues (non-security only)

## Compliance

### Standards Adherence

- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework alignment
- Industry best practices implementation

### Privacy

- No personal data collection without consent
- GDPR compliance for EU users (planned)
- Data minimization principles
- Secure data disposal

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels

Security updates are communicated through:
- GitHub security advisories
- Release notes
- Email notifications (for registered users)

### Update Process

1. Security patches are prioritized
2. Emergency releases for critical issues
3. Regular security updates in minor releases
4. Clear migration guides for breaking changes
